KSP Remote Launch
=================

KSP Addon - Allows you to create and launch vessels from custom launch sites.

Custom Launch Site editor available in either VAB and SPH.

Press 'L' to toggle the Remote Launch menu when in the editor.


Installation instructions
-------------------------
Extract the contents of the zip file to your main KSP directory (the one with KSP.exe in)


Known Issues
------------
Launching on sites that are on bodies other than Kerbin, the Mun and Minimus can cause the ship to either: 
 - start at a significant distance above the ground, causing the ship to fall towards the planet
 - start in the ground, causing the ship to explode

Changing the name of a launch site does not change the text on the button in the sites list.
